#INFORMATION SECURITY USING MULTI-MEDIA STEGANOGRAPHY


## About 
A message which can be hidden under a text, image, audio, video file

## Abstract
People Today look for the safest Way to protect and hide their Important information from someone who can disclose his privacy. Messages are the easiest way to get into one's workplace and discover all his Social and Economic Boundaries, Cryptography is a common technique but can be resolved by an effective algorithm Therefore finding a way that would help to hide and store confidential Documents of the people unnoticed by anybody? The solution to this is Multi-media   Steganography

## Introduction
Steganography is the technique in which the secret messages are hidden within the data. It keeps both the data and their existence in a secure manner. It is used in various real time applications and also it enables a secure communication. Text files, images, audios, and videos are used in steganography to conceal the communication. The main objective of this paper is to provide a general analysis on various approaches in video steganography. It covers related works, the strength of steganography, types of steganography and different techniques of video steganography. The absolute study of various techniques of video steganography is also highlighted.

## Proposed Work
In Multi-media Steganography, firstly we encode a message under an image using binary codes of message hiding it under the pixels of the image, and particularly for video the individual frames of the video are extracted and the audio is also extracted in the form of binary code, the frames are then encoded as per the binary values of the text message and the video is reconstructed to produce the Video with message using HFYU codec with frame rate as of the main video, which recreate the video without compressing it so that the message doesnâ€™t vanishes or gets effected. While making video we extract audio from the video file and again add it to the video. Then the decode function extract the hidden text from video with message by taking individual frames and joining it to deliver you the message encoded in the video.

## Conclusion
Steganography is applicable to, but not limited to, the following areas.  
1. Confidential communication and secret data storing 
2. Protection of data alteration 
3. Access control system for digital content distribution 
4. Media Database systems 
The area differs in what feature of the steganography is utilized in each system 

##Future work
1. Hide text under audio file and integrate it with video file to increase the security of the message. 2. Hide image under video file
